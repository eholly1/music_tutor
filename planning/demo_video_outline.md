- Vision
  - Think of your favorite musician. Yo-Yo Ma, Ella Fitsgerald, or my favorite, Miles Davis.
  - Now imagine that they were sitting in your living room, teaching you to play music in their style,
    through the conversational, call and response method that is a part of our DNA.
  - Let's be real - if Miles Davis were alive, I doubt he'd have the patience to do that with a beginner like
    me. But very soon, AI will make a teacher like this possible and accessible.
  - Come see the prototype.
